Based on the true story of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant accident and its aftermath, HBO's captivating and intense miniseries depicted the disaster in grim and visceral detail\u00a0that, at times, almost seemed like a documentary about an impossibly horrific event. Of course, it's worth noting that very few people actually have any sort of personal reference point to nuclear disasters, so a viewer who doesn't know the details of the real-life Chernobyl accident might find it difficult to determine whether the show's realism was unflinching dedication to depict the events in a historically accurate fashion, or if it was simply Hollywood magic at its most captivating. After all, \"Chernobyl\" creator Craig Mazin has since gone on to make \"The Last of Us,\" which can often be just as visceral but is obviously based on a video game series. With that in mind, let's take a look at just how realistic HBO's \"Chernobyl\" truly is.","label":0}

However, the Razr Ultra 2025 doesn't go overboard with the HDR, so images don't appear quite as artificial as they sometimes would from a Pixel, for example.

The aperture is slightly smaller than last year's model, so it won't naturally pull in as much light, but the slightly larger pixel size helps some. I won't call the low-light or nighttime images fantastic, and if you're not completely still, you'll likely get some blurry images, but they're an improvement over the Razr Plus 2024 (pre- Android 15 update).","label":0}

Until several recent media interviews, including one with the BBC in which he defended his decision to stay in the 2024 race until a late stage, Biden had largely receded from public view since leaving power in January. If the former president has the energy and endurance to do so, this latest medical revelation might give him a new platform, and a newly sympathetic public, to attempt to defend and burnish his presidential legacy.","label":0}

Yair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), sparked outrage on Monday when he said: \"Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don't return to acting like a sane country. \"A sane state does not wage war against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set itself the goal of depopulating the population,\" he told Israeli public radio's popular morning news programme.

Despite international pressure, including calls from the Trump administration for a ceasefire, Russia\u2019s strategic objective in the war in Ukraine remains unchanged: to seize more ground, even up to the outskirts of Kyiv. Economic Updates The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has lowered its 2025 real GDP growth forecast for Ukraine from 3.5% to 3.3%, citing war-driven economic headwinds, energy shortages and labor scarcity.

Or, in their own words: \u201cIn the future, we plan to: (i) explore combining acoustic features with FM representations, using feature concatenation before the downstream model or through late fusion methods within the model, for improved performance and investigate if such methods are able to capture complementary information and be more robust to individual variabilities;(ii) investigate fine-tuning the FMs to the target domains to reduce the domain mismatch and hence explore if such adaptation translates to improved performance, better mitigate the challenges in HR estimation, and capture complex pathological characteristics; (iii) assess their ap plicability to other downstream tasks and physiological pa rameters, including pathological conditions; (iv) augment and adapt more data that\u2019s clinically significant; (v) compare them with other bioacoustic foundation models, such as HeAR [30]; and (vi) explore model simplification strategies, such as pruning, distillation, and lightweight encoder design, to enable deployable solutions with lower computational cost while maintaining performance.\u201d The study obviously doesn\u2019t make any clinical claims or product promises.

{"text":"Cutting it fine is an understatement, there's no headroom for aging battery health here. Samsung has built the Edge with a battery capacity that clearly cuts it very fine for a full day of use. While the Galaxy S25 Edge might manage modest usage today, consider how it will perform after two or three years, especially at a price point of $1,100. A modest decline to 90% of its original battery capacity after two years could already spell trouble; a drop to 80% will have you reaching for a charger before the day is over. Additionally, we noticed the thin metal frame heating up frequently during use, which not only accelerates battery degradation but can also cause the battery to discharge inefficiently and increase self-discharge.","label":0}

This is partly because it was the first bug I manually discovered as part of this research, but mainly because it is incredibly convenient to exploit. The essence of this bug is that it was possible to load a hive with a security descriptor containing a refcount very close to the maximum 32-bit value (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFF), and then overflow it by creating a few more keys that used it. This resulted in a very powerful UAF primitive, as the incorrectly freed cell could be subsequently filled with new objects and then freed again any number of times.","label":0}

When the police arrive, Nica is ultimately charged with the murders, and hauled away to an institution. In Cult of Chucky , an abusive psychiatrist has convinced her she really was the perpetrator of the crime and Chucky was all in her head \u2014 until the doll shows up to kill more people.

It's a bit too early to say that we're seeing a shift to a period of rising demand, but one has been predicted for some time due to rising data center use and the increased electrification of transportation and appliances. Under those circumstances, the rest of the difference will be made up for with fossil fuels. Running counter to recent trends, the use of natural gas dropped during the first three months of 2025.","label":0}

{"text":"A memorandum of understanding between the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Guardia di Finanza, and AGCOM, established a \u201ccollaboration protocol\u201d where information on IPTV users would be shared between agencies. The source of this information wasn\u2019t made immediately clear, but it\u2019s likely that it applies to subscriber details obtained in IPTV raids that regularly take place in the country. These databases likely hold emails and other potentially identifiable information on (former) subscribers. With these details in hand, authorities can now approach suspected offenders. Backed by a new anti-piracy law introduced in 2023, which enables fines of up to \u20ac5,000 for repeat offender s, no time was wasted warning IPTV pirates that their time had run out.","label":0}

Google's Pixel issues after a monthly security patch reportedly continue, as users bring their voices together online. There's a lengthy thread on the Pixel Phone subreddit where users are reporting a severe hit to their device's battery life after the latest security update (via Android Headlines ). The original poster (OP) put up a screenshot of their Pixel's battery usage which showed their Wi-Fi connectivity sucked up 100% in three hours. While the user acknowledges this could be a (strange) bug, the root of the issue is that their device only lasted three hours.","label":0}

But Democratic Senators who are members of the crypto caucus\u2014Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester, Andy Kim, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Angela Alsobrooks (a co-sponsor for the bill) all voted no to closing debate. The change of heart from Dems\u2014who, again, could easily change course and pass this thing next Monday\u2014appears to stem in part over concerns regarding Donald Trump\u2019s growing crypto empire, which includes a recently launched stablecoin called $USD1 that the Trump-connected World Liberty Financial announced earlier this year. That stablecoin was recently in the news because an investment firm in Abu Dhabi announced it would use $USD1 to invest $2 billion into cryptocurrency exchange Binance , creating a seemingly endless web of conflicts of interest with the President at the center. Following that announcement, along with some reportedly unexpected changes made to the bill by Republicans without including Democrats in the conversation, led to Thursday\u2019s failure.","label":0}

What is a Gleason score? The Gleason grading system, or Gleason score, refers to how likely the cancer is to advance and spread, but does not predict the outcome. It's way of describing prostate cancer based on how abnormal the cancer cells in a biopsy sample look under a microscope and how quickly they are likely to grow and spread, according to the NIH.

How ex Cassie's testimony builds the sex trafficking case against him 17 May 2025 Share Save Madeline Halpert BBC News in New York court Share Save Reuters Sean Combs and Cassie at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala in 2015 In a trial that is undoing the legacy of one of music's biggest moguls of the 2000s, the focus of the opening week of proceedings was not Sean \"Diddy\" Combs  himself - but his ex-girlfriend. R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura took the witness stand for four days, describing in emotional details the years of beatings and drug-fuelled sex encounters with prostitutes that she alleges she endured at the hands of the rap superstar, who she dated for more than a decade. But while her story clearly left an impression on those in the courtroom, which one onlooker described as an \"aura of sadness\", it is just one piece in the puzzle that prosecutors must present to prove that Mr Combs was not just an abuser, but a mastermind of a criminal, sexual enterprise. On Tuesday, gasps erupted in a Manhattan overflow courtroom when prosecutors called Ms Ventura - their star witness - to the stand.","label":0}

Martin Rickett\/PA Images\/Getty Images TRENDING RUMORS - Wrexham will waste no time in their bid to earn top-flight football, and will target Premier League players to strengthen their squad. The Daily Telegraph explains that Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are eager to make it four consecutive promotions, and experienced names can make the difference. One such name is Fulham midfielder Tom Cairney , 34, who has won promotion from the Championship before, and is out of contract in July. The midfielder could yet sign a one-year extension, which could mean Wrexham would have to beat their own transfer record -- \u00a32 million for Sam Smith from Reading in January -- to get a deal done.","label":0}

Richard Gadd's partly autobiographical drama became one of the most dissected series of the year. Other nominees include Rivals, a Disney+ adaptation of a Jilly Cooper novel about two powerful men battling for control of a local TV network, and Slow Horses , about a dysfunctional unit within MI5 made up of disgraced agents. Say Nothing , which followed the lives of those growing up during the troubles in Belfast, is also nominated, alongside Mr Loverman , a screen adaptation of Bernadine Evaristo's novel about an elderly man whose marriage falls apart after his long-term affair with his male friend is revealed. Sherwood focused on a Nottinghamshire community still reeling from the 1980s miners' strike, while Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light continued Hilary Mantel's trilogy about Thomas Cromwell's continued rise to power and eventual fall from grace.","label":0}

He noted that Apple has never increased the price for an iPhone Pro ($999) since the iPhone X was first introduced in 2017. So yes, you should expect to pay more for the iPhone 17, regardless of tariffs. New iPhone 17 colors Rumors of a new color for the iPhone started in April, when Twitter user and leaker Majin Bu (not the Dragon Ball Z character) posted that the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max could get a sky blue option.

Laser ranging over lunar distances is challenging, requiring sending a high-power, precise beam over 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) to hit a small corner retroreflector, which bounces the laser pulse straight back where it came from. The return signal then needs to be picked up by a telescope using ultra-sensitive detectors. Doing this in the daytime brings the added challenge of massive background \"noise\" from the sun .

In addition to the Xring O1, Xiaomi unveiled the Xring T1, a smartwatch platform that will see a decent amount of use on the brand's wearables. The timing of this announcement is interesting as it comes just a week after Xiaomi and Qualcomm released a joint statement extending their 15-year partnership, and confirming that upcoming Xiaomi flagships will continue to use Qualcomm silicon.

{"text":"However, China fell well short of those levels, failing to purchase the promised volume of American products. Bessent told Fox News that the Trump Administration will take China\u2019s noncompliance into account when it negotiates a new trade deal. Trump has been particularly incensed that the U.S. remains the single-largest recipient of Chinese exports, but accounted for less than 13% of China's total exports. His initial trade war strategy centered on a series of escalating tariffs, peaking with the current 145% rate on most Chinese imports and prompting China to retaliate with 125% tariffs on American goods. Trump has predicted his tariffs will lead to a resurgence in domestic manufacturing, as companies relocate factories to the U.S. to avoid taxes on imports.","label":0}

{"text":"While it does an okay job of underscoring the game\u2019s bedlam, it never quite amplifies the gunplay, shield throws, and eyebrow-raising boss reveals the way I felt it should. If anything, it went unnoticed the more I played; even to a newbie, that struck me as a sacrilegious takeaway from the game. A few hours in, I barely noticed the music ramping up before fights, like it was struggling to punch above its weight (more than I was in a boss fight) to match the sheer insanity on screen. Finishing Move (known for\u00c2 Borderlands 3 ,\u00c2 Halo Wars 2 , and\u00c2 The Callisto Protocol ) composed the soundtrack, but for a game like Dark Ages , music needed to be a driving force, not just background noise. Eventually, I\u00c2 turned\u00c2 Dark Ages \u2018 music volume down and blasted \u00c2\u00a0Gordon\u2019s old tracks instead to make up for what the game lacked sonically.","label":0}

A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is based on a novella series Steffan Hill\/HBO Let's start with \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\"\u00a0which marks the second major \"Game of Thrones\" spin-off and is based on a series of novellas by George R.R. Martin about \"Dunk\" and \"Egg\" \u2014 two characters who grow up to be Ser Duncan the Tall (who runs the Kingsguard) and King Aegon V Targaryen, respectively. (Martin will truly do anything except write \"The Winds of Winter,\" huh?) Dunk is being portrayed by actor and former rugby player Peter Claffey, while Egg, who's just Prince Aegon Targaryen at the start of this story, is being played by Dexter Sol Ansell (a younger performer who can briefly be seen as a young Coriolanus Snow in \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\"). Other main cast members include Finn Bennett (as Egg's older brother, Aerion \"Brightflame\"\u00a0Targaryen), Bertie Carvel (Prince Baelor \"Breakspear\" Targaryen, Egg's uncle), and Daniel Ings (as Ser Lyonel Baratheon, the heir to his house and a fellow who's called the \"Laughing Storm\" by his enemies and allies alike).","label":0}

Instead, in selecting civilian leaders at the Pentagon, the president has prioritized perceived loyalty rather than experience.

{"text":"If you've been with the same internet provider for a while, it probably seems like it gets more expensive by the year. In fact, 63% of adults are paying $195 more on average for internet than they did last year, and high prices are the no. 1 reason people choose not to have a home internet connection at all. After analyzing over 150 plans from the country's biggest internet providers , I found that the median price for internet in the US is $63 per month for all speeds available, with autopay discounts applied. That price doesn\u2019t include the cost to rent equipment , which, on average, adds another $15 to your monthly bill. So the actual total comes to around $78 per month for home internet -- which is below the $89 monthly that US News & World Report found when it surveyed approximately 2,500 people in 2024.","label":0}

Medicaid's annual price tag has soared from about $590 billion in 2017 to nearly $900 billion today. If this script sounds familiar, it's because Republicans made the same proposals and arguments in 2017, when they last had narrow control of Congress and Trump in the White House. President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order after delivering remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event in the Rose Garden entitled \"Make America Wealthy Again\" at the White House in Washington, April 2, 2025.

Often with her apocalyptic scenes, there is a glimmer of hope, or a part of the painting that is calm \u2013 Jean McMeakin With the future so uncertain, De Morgan places the importance of spiritual fulfilment and happiness at the centre of much of her work. In Blindness and Cupidity Chasing Joy from the City (1897), for example, \"Cupidity\" is personified as a crowned figure clutching treasures who is driving away \"Joy\" in the form of an angel. Here, as in Death of the Dragon, the central characters are chained, suggesting trapped souls. In The Prisoner (1907-1908), the barred window and a woman's chained wrists make captivity a metaphor for gender inequality, hinting at the De Morgans' support for universal suffrage (Evelyn was a signatory of at least two important petitions, while her husband was vice-president of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage).","label":0}

Consumers, in turn, are panic-buying cars and wondering whether they'll have to bid farewell to Shein and Temu . In the tariff landscape, musical instruments occupy a middle ground that often goes overlooked: not big enough to weigh heavily on policy (or the discourse), not small enough to be shrugged off as another trivial consumer indulgence.

Still, an internal review of FEMA this month indicated the agency is \"not ready\" for the 2025 hurricane season. \"As FEMA transforms to a smaller footprint, the intent for this hurricane season is not well understood, thus FEMA is not ready,\" the review said, citing staffing limitations, hiring and a lack of coordination with states as the Trump administration attempts to reorganize and diminish FEMA. North Carolina is the second state to have a FEMA aid request denied after the agency rejected Arkansas' request for disaster relief when severe storms and tornados hit the state in March.

{"text":"Here\u2019s a set of skills and practices for parents of children with chronic illnesses or life-changing diagnoses that I recommend parents try: Flexibility: This first one is hard work, but recent research indicates cognitive flexibility is one of the most successful ways to deal with negative experiences. This means being lightly committed to any given solution, so that when we don\u2019t see the improvement we hoped for, we can pivot to a different strategy. Often we rigidly stick to the coping skills that have previously worked, but what helped in one situation might not help as much the next time. Flexibility lets us see multiple paths out of a tough spot, and the option to loop back to past strategies to find the right fit for what's needed at any moment. When my younger brother was diagnosed with ALS, I found daily 20-minute runs on a treadmill extremely helpful but only in the afternoons; in the evenings running just wound me up and ruined my sleep, and running in the mornings was too complicated to fit into my caregiving and work schedule.","label":0}

{"text":"I did this because it is much easier to generate a reliably reproducible crash by accessing a freed allocation on the pool than when accessing a freed but still mapped cell in the hive. However, this is certainly not the only way to cause pool memory corruption by modifying the internal data of the regf format. Another idea would be, for example, to create a very long \"big data\" value in the hive (over ~16 KiB in a hive with version \u2265 1.4) and then cause _CM_KEY_VALUE.DataLength to be inconsistent with the _CM_BIG_DATA.Count field, which denotes the number of 16-kilobyte chunks in the backing buffer. If we look at the implementation of the internal CmpGetValueData function, it is easy to see that it allocates a paged pool buffer based on the former value, and then copies data to it based on the latter one. Therefore, if we set _CM_KEY_VALUE.DataLength to a number less than 16344 \u00d7 (_CM_BIG_DATA.Count - 1), then the next time the value's data is requested, a linear pool buffer overflow will occur.","label":0}

Motorola has made great strides with the Razr series, not just in terms of design and specs but also in terms of camera performance. However, when it comes to the best Android smartphone cameras, Motorola isn't often at the top of anyone's list, which is why the Razr Ultra 2025 is a welcome surprise for me. The phone has an impressive camera system for a flip phone, and that's not just because it has three 50MP sensors. One of the most important changes is the switch to a secondary ultrawide sensor after the Razr Plus 2024 opted for a 2x telephoto lens , giving the Razr Ultra more versatility than its predecessor.","label":0}

{"text":"Doctor Who loves itself a bit of tonal variance: arguably the show is at its best when it can be making you laugh at high-camp shenanigans one moment, and then be terrified the next. But what is so jarring throughout \u201cThe Interstellar Song Contest,\u201d putting aside its allegorical pitfalls for a moment, is that its tonal clash rarely feels like a point the episode wants to engage with as it bizarrely jumps between the gravity of the situation (well, the \u201cmavity,\u201d thanks to the return of that joke, although again, it feels kind of out of place when people are saying it about trying to save 100,000 concert attendees who just got sucked into the vacuum of space) and the zillion other things pinging around in its proverbial head. Actually, really, you can\u2019t talk about the tonal weirdness of this episode without engaging what the episode presents itself as saying more broadly being about beneath the high-glitz facade of its Eurovision knockoff, so we might as well get into that. The inciting incident at the crux of \u201cThe Interstellar Song Contest\u201d is that its setting, an interstellar space stadium, the Harmony Arena, is overtaken by two rogue members of a species of horned beings called the Hellions, Kid (Freddie Fox) and his girlfriend\/person-on-the-inside, a broadcast operator named Wynn (Iona Anderson).","label":0}

Jeff Stein May 24, 2025 93 Share this post SpyTalk Death of a Master Manipulator Copy link Facebook Email Notes More 14 38 Share Michael Ledeen (2018, Formiche.net) Michael Ledeen, the controversial national security journalist, scholar and schemer who died at age 83 on May 17 from complications following a stroke, played a significant covert role leading up to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, as well as other productions of false intelligence for political ends. Ledeen was featured prominently in The Italian Letter , a 2007 book by SpyTalk Contributing Editor Peter Eisner\u00a0and Knut Royce, a Pulitzer Prize-winning\u00a0 investigative reporter at Newsday.

On occasions he does get beaten, he can often recover. In Champions League appearances this term, his anticipation and reading of the game have stood out, but his on-the-ball play has often been fairly basic (especially when he's on the flank).

In recent days, the seats have begun to fill up and coverage of the trial has increased as it moves towards a close. Many commentators have noted how the Le Scouarnec trial, like the Pelicot case, has exposed the deep institutional failings which enabled the surgeon to continue his rapes long after they could have been detected and stopped. Dominique Pelicot had been caught \"upskirting\" in a supermarket in 2010 and his DNA quickly linked to an attempted rape in 1999 \u2013 a fact that, astonishingly, wasn't followed up for a whole decade.","label":0}

Brendan Smialowski\/AFP via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Brendan Smialowski\/AFP via Getty Images Republican lawmakers are signaling growing concern over President Trump's openness to accepting a $400 million plane from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One, an unprecedented move fraught with ethical and legal issues that is testing even his biggest loyalists. The chorus of reservations being expressed by Republican lawmakers represents a rare break with the president, who typically enjoys near total unanimity from the party. On Wednesday, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, was among those taking issue with the idea. McCaul said he certainly received gifts in his former role as chair of the House Foreign Affairs committee and believed countries can gift to other countries, but a luxury Boeing 747 jet may go too far.","label":0}

{"text":"This is because creating volatile keys does not require any special permissions compared to regular keys. Additionally, if we have a memory corruption primitive within one storage type, we can easily influence data within the other. For example, in the case of stable storage memory corruption, it is enough to craft a value for which the cell index _CM_KEY_VALUE.Data has the highest bit set, and thus points to the volatile space. From this point, we can arbitrarily modify regf structures located in that space, and directly read\/write out-of-bounds pool memory by setting a sufficiently long value size (exceeding the bounds of the given bin). Such a situation is shown in the diagram below: This behavior can be further verified on a specific example.","label":0}

The longtime focal point of cinema has lost a lot of opportunities to the rest of the world: There are other major American hubs, including in Georgia and New Mexico, but plenty more in regions such as Europe and Australia, where tax incentives are plentiful and labor is often far cheaper.

In 2024, 18% of French citizens accessed sports content illegally, a figure unchanged from the previous year. Arcom notifications led to the blocking of 3,800 domains, with the Paris court adding over 400 in the same period. Concerns over pirate IPTV uptake will likely persist after 41% of users admitted that their new hobby is less than a year old. Around 15 years ago, the French government launched an expansive monitoring and enforcement system to fight online piracy.","label":0}

The team was based at McMaster University in Ontario and they found a new molecule that could help to create the first new class of antibiotics in over 20 years. The molecule is called lariocidin and it is a lasso peptide. The team was able to find this molecule by analyzing bacterium that are in the genus Paenibacillus, which is found in the soil in many places.

In a Wednesday note obtained by Market Watch , Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye insisted that Trump does, in fact, always chicken out. So far, that\u2019s been true for enacting additional tariffs on Mexico and Canada, postponing his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff plan on dozens of countries after his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement went south, delaying a tariff on imports from the European Union, and smashing his plan to fine China, temporarily decreasing tariffs on Chinese products to 30 percent from 145 percent. \u201cSo, the returns are somewhat conclusive: The TACO trade has worked and buying stocks on extreme tariff-related threats has worked,\u201d Essaye wrote, noting that the known gambit\u2019s growing popularity will translate to diminished returns.","label":0}

If Intel continues its current Battlemage trend, the B770 could launch with 16GB+ of VRAM, plenty of power for 1440p, and a more affordable price. It's all speculation at this point.","label":0}

It's unclear if the F-35 was the target or to what extent the fighter was at risk. Neither the Pentagon nor US Central Command, which oversees Middle East operations, has responded to Business Insider's queries on this incident. The incident is notable because the F-35, a fifth-generation fighter jet with advanced stealth capabilities built by US defense contractor Lockheed Martin , was made to pierce contested airspace defended by sophisticated air defenses and advanced enemy aircraft and suppress enemy capabilities or feed targeting data to other assets. Last year, Israeli F-35s demonstrated the fighter jet's ability to fulfill this role by striking inside Iran.","label":0}
